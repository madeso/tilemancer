# deprecation notice

I decided to deprecated my fork of tilemancer as I want the ability to embed the generator and the tilemancer license is too restricting for my taste in this matter.
The general implementation of the app also leaves things to be desired. I for example feel much could be simplified if it was based on dear imgui and sol instead of manually implementing it.

With that in mind, I decided to create a similar but seperate project: [textgen](https://github.com/madeso/textgen).

# tilemancer
Tilemancer is a quick procedural tile creator designed for pixel-art games. Perfect for game jams, prototypes, texture mods, and more.

You can design tiles using a node-based approach in which a heightmap is created and later shaded by the program.

The program features a collection of noise generators, filters and presets, giving you freedom and speed when creating your own tiles.

All nodes and presets are programmed in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), letting you create and modify effects.

Head to the [Discussion Board](https://led.itch.io/tilemancer/community) for tutorials on how to use Tilemancer and how to create your own nodes.
